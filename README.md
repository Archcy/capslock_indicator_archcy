## a java version capslock indicator
My laptop dosen't have a capslock LED light.
So I write this for personal use.\n
I use [system-hook](https://github.com/kristian/system-hook) in order to listen Global Keyboard event.\n

you import [system-hook](https://github.com/kristian/system-hook) can build it by yourself.

if you have any suggestions,please submit a issue.
