## a java version capslock indicator
My laptop dosen't have a capslock LED light.
So I write this for personal use.

download at [this](https://github.com/Archcy/capslock_indicator_archcy/releases).

I use [system-hook](https://github.com/kristian/system-hook) in order to listen Global Keyboard event.

you can import [system-hook](https://github.com/kristian/system-hook) and build it by yourself.

## usage info
* run the jar file,an indicator will show at your button of screen.
* drag the indicator to move it.
* right click to exit.

if you have any suggestions,please submit a issue.
